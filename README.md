# Overthewire Solutions

## Why does this repository exists?

While solving the first challenge, bandit, I had a hard time finding two things:

1.	Quality solutions
2.	Hints to solve the challenge instead of the solution given right away

This is because of this lack that I decided to record what I learned in this Github Repository

## What should you expect to find in this repository?

The name is pretty self-explanatory, you'll find the solutions to the Overthewire Wargames.
However, even though you'll find the solutions, the documentation will also include some commonly 
encountered difficulties and some hints before unveilling the solution so that any person that comes 
here looking for advice without being spoiled the solution can do so without any fear.

## But Chary, what are the overthewire wargames?

Let's ask ChatGPT to describe the wargames:

OverTheWire is a platform offering a variety of cybersecurity wargames designed to teach and improve hacking and security skills through hands-on practice.
