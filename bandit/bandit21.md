## Level Goal

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based **job scheduler**. 
Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

## Commands useful to solve the level

- [cron](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/cron.8.html)
- [crontab(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html)
- [crontab(1)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/crontab.1.html)

## Helpful Reading Material
