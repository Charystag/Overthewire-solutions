## Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a **hexdump** of a file that has been **repeatedly compressed**. 
For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. 
Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

## Commands useful to solve the level

- cp
- mv
- mktemp
- tar
- gzip
- bzip2
- xxd
